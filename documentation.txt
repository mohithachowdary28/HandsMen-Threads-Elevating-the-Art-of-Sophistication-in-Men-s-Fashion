Project Title: HandsMen Threads – Create Batch Apex
Platform: Salesforce CRM | Apex | Flow Builder | Developer Console

Description:
As part of the "HandsMen Threads" project, I developed a custom Batch Apex class to efficiently process large datasets asynchronously within the Salesforce platform. This implementation supported the brand’s backend data automation for managing high-volume records related to fashion product logistics and order processing.

Key Contributions:

Created a reusable Batch Apex class using the Database.Batchable interface.

Accessed and modified Salesforce data using SOQL queries and DML operations in Apex.

Designed and tested logic using the Developer Console and Anonymous Apex blocks.

Applied best practices such as bulk-safe operations, governor limit awareness, and error handling.

Documented the code and added inline comments for maintainability and clarity.

Contributed to project progress and worked collaboratively in an agile task-based environment with SkillWallet.

Outcome:
Achieved scalable data processing within governor limits and improved automation of backend processes for the e-commerce workflow.
